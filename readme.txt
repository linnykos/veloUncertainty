This repository contains all the code used for the analyses in our paper, which involve five RNA velocity methods and three datasets. The 'code' folder is organized by dataset and method, and includes scripts for count splitting as well as for computing replicate coherence and signal-to-random coherence scores. The 'veloUncertainty' folder contains custom functions used in these analyses. The produced figures can be found in the 'fig' folder.

This code is accompanying the paper “Assessing RNA velocity stability across synthetic replicates using count splitting” (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.11.23.625009).
